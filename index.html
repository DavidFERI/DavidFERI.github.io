          <h3>Tenzor d.o.o</h3>
          <h4>Full-Stack Developer(Full time)</h4>
          <p>
            After 2 years of Internship I started working as a full time
            Full-Stack developer. I'm now working on multiple large projects,
            like: smart security sistems, ANPR (Automatic Number-Plate
            Recogniton) systems, Custom Web applications, Custom .NET Desktop
            applications, Device monitoring systems, Scheduling systems, Restful
            APIs and many many more. I'm always looking for new ideas, that I
            can transform into software solutions that could potentially make
            the company name better.

          <h4>Full-Stack Developer(Internship)</h4>
          <p>
            As an Intern at Tenzor I had to look at all software solutions the
            company has to offer. I had to look at every detail how each and
            every software solution has been developed. Most of the software was
            developed for smart traffic solutions, smart libraries, smart shops
            and many more solutions for places where you could one way or
            another simplify end users life routine. As the time went by I
            started to develop my own software with which I could simplify my
            work environment: Smart RPI radio, Node-red door operator, and many
            many more. I also started upgrading and optimizing existing software
            solutions and started working on my first but small projects for
            Tenzor end users. As an Intern I saw an opportunity in Android app
            development (lack of mobile app development in the company) and
            developed quite a few Android apps for the company, that we're using
            regularly.

              <h3>Satisfaction Reporting</h3>
              <p>
                I developed NodeJS server application, Android mobile
                application and ReactJS web application. Server application is
                used as an interface layer between data and graphical user
                interface. It manages the data that is stored in MongoDB
                database and provides us with web servis endpoints for data
                management. Mobile application gives us the ability to provide
                the rating of the satisfaction using the QR code scanning (we
                can scan a QR code for faster satisfaction reporting), while the
                web application on the other hand gives us the ability to
                provide the rating of the satisfaction and the ability to
                analyze the satisfaction data. This software solution is used in
                healthcare center in Maribor, where we're analyzing satisfaction
                data of patients. Software was validated by the healthcenter
                Maribor.

              <h3>Smart Beehive RPI</h3>
              <p>
                This project started as a fun home Node-red project, which is
                now used on daily basis. We had an idea to grab data from
                sensors (sensors are located at friends beehive) that are
                connected to our RPI, and save the data to our server for
                further use. With saved data we could then show graphs,
                calculate some numbers and act based on those numbers etc. So we
                implemented a software solution for getting the weight of honey,
                moisture and temperature in the beehive. Each day at a specific
                hour we grab previously mentioned data and save it onto a
                server. We're also grabbing the temperature and moisture data
                each 15 minutes so we can check rise and fall of the temperature
                more frequently. Using the Node-red dashboard we're then able to
                look at the statistic data, show graphs etc. We're also using
                messaging services for instant message after the measurements
                have been done.

                This was one of the school projects. Me and 3 of my dev friends
                wanted to have an Android app where we could upload our plans
                for the day. We also wanted to have the ability to add our
                routines, create custom events, have notifications etc. I was
                working on the widget of the application. The widget was
                designed in the same way like our main app (this was my main
                goal).

                This was the first big Android application that I developed
                myself. I always wanted to have a mobile application where I
                could check all fashion shops in one place, check their
                inventory, prices, shop location, shop ratings, shop phone
                numbers etc. With this app I learned how to develop Android
                applications the right way.
